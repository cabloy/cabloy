# What is CabloyJS

CabloyJS is a NodeJS full-stack framework with `workflow engine`, a low-code development platform for developers, is also a PAAS platform with both `out-of-the-box` and `flexible-customization`. Only one set of codes is needed to realize the `backend admin management system` and the `frontend applications` at the same time. And only one set of codes is needed to adapt to `PC` and `Mobile` at the same time, and the `Mobile` is close to the native experience
