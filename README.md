# What is CabloyJS

CabloyJS is a NodeJS full-stack framework with `workflow engine`, a low-code development platform for developers, is also a PAAS platform with both `out-of-the-box` and `flexible-customization`. Only one set of codes is needed to realize the `backend admin management system` and the `frontend applications` at the same time. And only one set of codes is needed to adapt to `PC` and `Mobile` at the same time, and the `Mobile` is close to the native experience

Cabloy5 uses Typescript to carry out a complete restructuring of the entire full-stack framework:

|          | Technology Stacks                                         |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Frontend | TS, Vue3, TSX, IOC, Quasar                                |
| Backend  | TS, Egg3, Multi database compatibility(Mysql, Postgresql) |

## Zova

Zova is a vue3 framework with ioc container. With the support of ioc container, defining reactive states no longer needs `ref/reactive`, nor `ref.value`

Zova is an independent front-end framework hatched in the process of developing Cabloy5. It uses TypeScript, using universal design, and can be used with any UI library
